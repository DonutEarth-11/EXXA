# Exoplanet_detection_dataset

\
This repository contains setup and parameter files required to generate simulated data of protoplanetary disks with embedded planets. It also contains a single dataset which serves as an example.
\
\
The `Fargo3d_files` contains parameter files and outputs of a [FARGO3d](https://fargo3d.bitbucket.io/download.html) simulation setup.\
The `fargo2radmc3d_files` contains simulated images of protoplanetary disks generated by radiative transfer simulations using RADMC3d code and the required parameter file to run the [fargo2radmc3d](https://github.com/charango/fargo2radmc3d) code.
